# Legacy Sitemap Generator

Helps to generate sitemaps for legacy parts of the website.

Normally, you add a sitemap generator to your framework, but if you have
some miscellaneous pages, a few old database tables with content, or multiple CMSs
you need more sitemaps.  This is a tool to write a sitemap that'll include a mishmash
of various URLs.

It does *not* spider pages.  It generates the URLs from data sources.

The included sample works with sf-active.
